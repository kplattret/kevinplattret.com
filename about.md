My name is Kevin Plattret and I am a Web Developer. I also enjoy design and like to explore and learn new things.

I come from Dijon, Burgundy, France where I spent the first twenty years of my life. I first studied English Language, Literature and Civilisation at the University of Burgundy, and then decided to take a completely different route. Having always been passionate about the internet and technology in general, I decided to study Digital Media at the Technical Institute of Dijon.

Two years ago I moved to the beautiful city of London in the UK. I work at [3beards](//3-beards.com) where I take care of the development of our websites. Before that I worked at [Top Left Design](//topleftdesign.com) as a Web Developer and Project Manager for a couple of years.

You can find me on [Twitter](//twitter.com/kplattret) and subscribe to my updates on [Facebook](//facebook.com/kevinplattret). If you need to get in touch you can always [email me](mailto:kevin@plattret.me) and I will try to get back to you in reasonable time.
