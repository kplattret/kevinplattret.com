    <p>My name is Kevin Plattret and I am a Web Developer. I also enjoy design and like to explore and learn new things.</p>

    <p>I come from Dijon, Burgundy, France where I spent the first twenty years of my life. I first studied English Language, Literature and Civilisation at the University of Burgundy, and then decided to take a completely different route. Having always been passionate about the internet and technology in general, I decided to study Digital Media at the Technical Institute of Dijon.</p>

    <p>Two years ago I moved to the beautiful city of London in the UK. I work at <a href="//3-beards.com" target="_blank">3beards</a> where I take care of the development of our websites. Before that I worked at <a href="//topleftdesign.com" target="_blank">Top Left Design</a> as a Web Developer and Project Manager for a couple of years.</p>

    <p>You can find me on <a href="//twitter.com/kplattret" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and subscribe to my updates on <a href="//www.facebook.com/kevinplattret" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. If you need to get in touch you can always <a href="mailto:kevin@plattret.me">email me</a> and I will try to get back to you in reasonable time.</p>
