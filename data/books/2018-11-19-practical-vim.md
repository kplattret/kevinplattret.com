I have been using Vim as my main code editor for over a year now and I picked this up to take
things to the next level. It is full of useful tips; most of which I already knew, but I also learnt
quite a few tricks that will save me loads of time! I enjoyed the read overall and I definitely
recommend it if you're considering reading it, no matter if you're a beginner or a more advanced Vim
user, there will be something in there for you to learn. I will certainly get back to some sections
myself to fine-tune my workflow.
