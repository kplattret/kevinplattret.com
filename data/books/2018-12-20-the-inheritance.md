This is one the most important contemporary work I've read to date. I saw the play earlier this year
and I was deeply moved by the story, its relevance, and the message it carries to our generation and
the next ones.

We shall never forget the constant challenges and the tragedies that the homosexual community
suffered throughout the past decades. Matthew Lopez's play is a bold message of love and friendship.
It stands as a beautifully-put-together reminder to try and accept our past, as well as understand
it, so that we can better face our future. So that we can learn to cherish our present.
