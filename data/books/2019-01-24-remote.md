I quite liked this book; it's full of great tips on how to adopt remote working and make it
successful, especially if you're new to the idea. I didn't learn much from it, but that's probably
because I'm lucky enough to already have a lot of flexibility with the way I work. It certainly made
me want to push it even further and work full-time remotely at some point!
