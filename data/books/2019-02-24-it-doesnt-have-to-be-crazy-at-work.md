Thought-provoking and highly inspirational. This book questions the way many companies carry their
work nowadays and how craziness has become the new norm in the workplace. It offers a measured and
sensible approach to doing business, putting people first and growth second, arguing that calm and
balance are key for sustained success. I find Basecamp's story admirable and it very much resonates
with me today.
