It took me a while to convince myself to start reading the first book of this trilogy, mostly
because I hadn't read any fantasy for quite a few years, but also because I wasn't sure it would
live up to my expectations. A month and a half later, I have finished all three books and I wish
there was more to it. The story is captivating, the style quite sharp and the characters very
attaching. I'll certainly get back to reading more fantasy and definitely more of Schwab, sooner
than later.
