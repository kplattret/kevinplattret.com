I thought this book was promising when I first found out about it. My expectations weren't exactly
great, because of the predominent romance theme, but I was hoping for a pleasant read to balance out
the non-fiction stuff I was reading in parallel.

The plot is fairly simple and predictible. The writing style is almost good in some passages but
deceptively poor otherwise, and maybe a tad too sweary/dirty. What really didn't work for me though,
is the omnipresent and heavily biased political stance that the story revolves around. It felt too
close to the reality of our politics, whatever the allegiance, and that overwhelmingly tainted the
story. To me, that generally feels out of place in a fiction novel, especially one that is labelled
as "young adult". I'm surprised by the countless praises this book has been given; people love it.
