This is very much in the same spirit as the 37signals books and I really enjoyed it. Being a
software engineer who has been considering starting his own company for a couple of years now, I can
identify with the author to some extent. This book is packed with practical advice and makes you ask
yourself the right questions around your lifestyle, so you can be more prepared should you want to
start your own company of one. I was already sold with the idea before this book, but I think this
might very well give me the extra confidence I need to make it happen one day.
