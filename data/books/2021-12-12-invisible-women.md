A crucial read for anyone who thinks that systematic bias against women isn't an issue or a thing at
all. An eye-opening read for me, who never thought hard enough about the depth and the overwhelming
omnipresence of the challenges women face, even in modern, developed countries.

An urgent call to action, for us all to make a conscious effort to include and promote women in all
aspects of society. Parity in sex representation is absolutely key to help solve the countless
problems the author explores in this work; problems that have in most cases and for way too long,
been considered as trivial.
