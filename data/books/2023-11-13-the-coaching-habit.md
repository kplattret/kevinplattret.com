This book is packed with very practical advice on how to refrain from giving advice. It does a great
job at convincing you that listening carefully to the person you're talking to, and challenging them
a little by asking the right questions, at the right time, will make a whole world of difference
compared to offering advice outright.

> "What's the real challenge here for you?" is the question that will help slow down the rush to
> action, so you spend time solving the real problem, not just the first problem.

The author presents seven questions as complementary tools to make sure that every one-on-one
conversation you have brings value to both parties involved. Seven questions to master in order to
become more of a coaching and inspiring leader, as a people manager. There is one loud message
coming back throughout the book: the answers you can get from someone, with some nudging, are often
a lot more effective and yield better results than the ones you could offer them.

> Your job as a manager and a leader is to help create the space for people to have learning moments
> [through their work].

The promise of the impact those coaching questions can have is diligently supported by relevant
research, which I found quite useful. Included are some good tips on forming new habits, a little
bit of human interaction psychology and advice on how to be a great listener. Overall, I found The
Coaching Habit to be a compelling reminder to say less, indeed, and be more intentional in how I
drive individual conversations. I'll certainly be practicing those learnings and what's more, I got
a lot of other resources to go through later, to dig deeper.
