I really wanted to like this novel and I think I did, just about. This is the first fiction I read
by Cory Doctorow and I'll definitely read more, but I admit I found the story a little underwhelming
overall. The heavy use of tech jargon and buzz-words, right from the beginning, made me cringe
slightly, and then it got better, or maybe I just got used to it. Throughout the first few chapters,
I just couldn't shake the feeling that the narrator was trying too hard to sound smart and trendy.
Eventually I did warm up to the story though, and got to enjoy it.

However clich√©, as a Silicon Valley veteran, Martin Hench is a likeable character. He is a true
ladies' man, has a taste for fine beverages and food, understands cyber-security better than the
vast majority of people, and has a knack for solving complex challenges in the mass surveillance
world we live in. More importantly, Martin comes across as a decent person, with similarly decent
principles. I wish we explored his personality in more detail, something that the rest of the series
might offer us.

The author's voice is clearly recognisable here, with the quasi-omnipresence of mild satire that
reflects his values and the ideals he fights for. All in all, this was entertaining enough and I'm
curious to read the already-announced sequel.
