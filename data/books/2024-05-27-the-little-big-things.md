Henry Fraser's story is a poignant one. At first it sounds like a terrible dream, a misadventure
that could happen to anyone and should happen to no one. A kind of event that one couldn't possibly
prevent without living a dull life as a consequence. His account of the life-changing accident he
and his family went through felt both astonishing and humbling to me. A life lesson.

> I thought: _If I wake up and can walk, I will never take anything for granted, ever again._

I don't want to take things for granted, and certainly not my mobility, but I often do. Privileges
come in all shapes and sizes, something important to remind ourselves of frequently. Not to
cultivate a sense of guilt, because there should be none, but rather to improve our awareness, our
empathy, and with mobility in particular, to encourage ourselves to treasure it.

Growing up as a teenager has its own set of challenges, but navigating such a disruptive life event
at the same time must have such a profound impact on oneself. While it appears evident in the book
that Henry received unconditional love and support from his family, his sudden disability inevitably
forced him to grow into a responsible adult a lot faster than most people. This maturity transpires
throughout the book, along with an optimistic and determined personality, with a positive outlook on
life that feels highly contagious.

Discovering The Little Big Things in the West End last year was, as J.K. Rowling puts it, "truly
inspirational". Reading it from the man himself felt even more authentic if possible. Here is a book
I will know to reach for in those times when life seems to get a little too complicated.
