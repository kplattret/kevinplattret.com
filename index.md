  Hello! I'm Kevin, a software engineer who loves solving problems with code and building products
  that make the Internet a better place for everyone. I'm always learning something new.

Most recently, I worked across several teams at [Deliveroo](/work) since 2016, focusing primarily on
making the delivery network more resilient and helping riders get paid as quickly as possible.

When I'm not writing [code](https://github.com/kplattret), I have quite a few activities that fight
for my attention. Among other things I enjoy reading books, exploring the outdoors on my bike or on
foot, playing video-games, taking [pictures](https://instagram.com/kplattret), cooking and playing
the violin.
