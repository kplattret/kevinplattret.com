Hello, I'm Kevin Plattret, a web developer, startup enthusiast and accidental designer. I enjoy
building products that make the internet a better place for everyone and learning new things as I
go.

I'm currently working at [3beards](http://3-beards.com) with a team of amazing people. We exist to
create meaningful experiences and connections that enable the startup community to thrive. A bold
mission, but we put a lot of heart into our work and the response has been tremendous so far.

Before that, I worked at [Top Left Design](http://topleftdesign.com) for a couple of years after
studying Digital Media at the University of Burgundy.

I grew up near Chalon-sur-Sa√¥ne in Burgundy, France, where I spent the first twenty two years of my
life. In 2011 I moved to the beautiful city of London in the UK and have been living here since
then.

Feel free to get in touch, I'm [@kplattret](https://twitter.com/kplattret) on Twitter.
