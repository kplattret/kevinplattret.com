  <p>I believe in people. I love to share, to work with others, to help by creating content, tools and services. People are the reason behind most products, and without them my job would not be the same.</p>

  <p>As a web developer I do my best to use my knowledge and experience to improve things and make the internet a better place for everyone. One conversation at a time. One line of code at a time. One pixel at a time.</p>
