    <p>This is a selection of my work. I will not list all the projects I have done or contributed to here, instead I decided to show you examples which I think reflect my work the most. I hope to grow this list soon!</p>

    <h2>Focus PR</h2>

    <p>The lastest website I built was for <a href="//focuspr.co.uk" target="_blank">Focus PR</a>, a London based PR agency. That was my last project as part of the team at <a href="//topleftdesign.com" target="_blank">Top Left Design</a>, with <a href="//cargocollective.com/aricdesign" target="_blank">Aric Arthur</a> on the design. We took pride in working all the details and make this full CMS website an enjoyable user experience. The client was very happy with the result. So were we.</p>

    <h2>Help Centre</h2>

    <p>I designed and built a system that helps web design companies to manage projects and clients. The Help Center was thought as a simple platform where a web design agency can share information with their clients and gather all the details about each project. It includes client manuals, project information such as history, documents, maintenance time tracking, and much more.</p>
