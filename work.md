## Unicorn Hunt

A magical beast of a job board and 3beards' answer to the increasing need for talent in startups.
[Unicorn Hunt](https://unicornhunt.io) was built within a few months by the talented [Stef
Lewandowski](https://twitter.com/stef) and launched in January 2015. Since then I've been in charge
of maintaining it and building further functionality.

## 3beards

The [3beards website](http://3-beards.com) is a hub for the startup enthusiast and the startup
curious. It gathers upcoming community events, stories and news, job ads and office space available
for hire. It's also the first Ruby on Rails application I built from scratch, with [Michael
Hobson](https://twitter.com/imhobson) on the design.

## Hackathon Wiki

At 3beards we used to organise hackathon events. I built this quick Ruby on Rails app that allowed
us to communicate various information to the participants and let them submit and document their
hacks in one place. A very simple tool functionality wise, with a minimalist design.
